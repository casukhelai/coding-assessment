# coding-assessment: Homework #4 JavaScript Quiz

## Description
This project I set out to create a JavaScript Quiz. There is a Start Game button and a timer starts and 6 questions appear with four different options. At the end there is a submission bar for a user to put their initials to save their highscore. Some problems:
- I couldn't get the quiz to save the initials, even with the localStorage property.
- Submit resets the quiz and takes it back to the home screen.
- If a user gets a question correct, it does not prompt anything. But if user get question wrong, there is an alert that pops up.
- The score = the time remaining on the timer, and the console logged the appropriate number, but I couldn't get the number to get stored.

Things I learned:
- Use functions in order to create parameters and call them in other functions
- start fleshing out the functions FIRST and then declare the variables you will need, rather than the other way around

## Usage
Click Start Button -> answer questions -> If you get an answer wrong, you'll be prompted that it was the incorrect answer and 10 seconds will be docked from the time remaining.
